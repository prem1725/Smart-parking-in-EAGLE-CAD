# Smart-parking-in-EAGLE-CAD
World's population is growing in a rapid sense. Because of this the parking becomes really tough in many cities and result in vehicles circulating in the streets. Smart parking systems have become a very helpful but they are usually complex and expensive. Their installation has to be done by specialized staff and even the structure needs to be modified. A lot of money and time should be spent on the maintenance. This system helps building a more simple and practical solution and also it is cheap. 


In this project that is build in EAGLE CAD we have a magnetic sensor and an IR sensor for evaluation purposes. The magnetic sensor would help the device to recognize any empty parking spot. The reason why I didn't use IR or UV sensor for this task is because UV sensor detects small objects like stones or the parking meter as an object and wouldn't be accurate.
IR sensor would detect the path for the parking however, it would detect the car with the same accuracy as magnetic sensor, hence IR sensor is used as an end sensor for perfect parking.
